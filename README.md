## 1. Abstract

### 1.1 Overview

<p>Swarm analysis investigates the collaborative dynamics of multiple autonomous agents working collectively to achieve shared objectives. Rooted in natural systems such as ant colonies, bee hives, and bird flocks, the field explores how simple, local interactions among individual agents give rise to complex, efficient, and adaptive group behaviors. This decentralized approach, wherein agents follow straightforward rules and interact locally, enables swarms to adapt to environmental changes and maintain functionality even when individual components fail. These principles ensure robustness, resilience, and adaptability in both natural and engineered systems, particularly in robotics.</p>

<p>Drawing inspiration from biological and ecological systems, swarm analysis examines how social insects and animals exhibit sophisticated group behaviors that allow them to perform critical tasks like foraging, building, and protection. Ants, for instance, employ pheromone trails for efficient resource discovery, while bees utilize the "waggle dance" for directing hives toward nectar sources. Similarly, flocking birds exhibit coordinated movements that enhance predator evasion and energy conservation. These natural systems demonstrate the power of decentralized, self-organized behaviors, where simple individual actions culminate in achieving complex group objectives, offering a model for robust, adaptive, and scalable systems.</p>

### 1.2 Swarm analysis in robotics and warehouse application

<p>Swarm robotics leverages principles inspired by nature to enable groups of autonomous robots to perform tasks collaboratively using simple rules and local interactions. This decentralized approach ensures dynamic task allocation, scalability, and robust adaptability to failures or environmental changes. By minimizing human intervention, swarm systems enhance efficiency, resilience, and sustainability in complex operational settings.</p>

<p>This project implements swarm robotics in a warehouse environment using a two-robot system. Each robot, powered by an ATmega328P microcontroller, is coordinated through an Xbee-based central controller that ensures synchronization and prevents task overlaps. The robots navigate, allocate tasks, and optimize energy usage, triggering alerts when batteries are low. This showcases the potential of scalable, efficient, and resilient robotic systems to improve warehouse automation and overall productivity through collaboration and energy-aware operations.</p>


## 2. Motivation 

<p>The rapid expansion of e-commerce and logistics industries has driven a significant demand for efficient and automated warehouse solutions. To meet rising consumer expectations and navigate the complexities of modern supply chains, businesses increasingly rely on automation to streamline operations and reduce costs.</p>

<po>Swarm robotics presents an innovative approach to enhancing warehouse efficiency by reducing human intervention and improving overall operational effectiveness. The collaborative capabilities of swarms enable optimized task distribution and resource utilization, facilitating seamless workflows. By harnessing swarm intelligence, warehouses benefit from task allocation, accelerated decision-making, and improved scalability, achieving enhanced performance and efficient resource management.</p>

## 7. Main Issues Faced

### 7.1 Baud Rate Mismatch

During the configuration and testing of the XBee communication with the ATmega328P microcontroller, we encountered a significant issue with the baud rate. Despite configuring the system to operate at a baud rate of <b>115200</b>, we observed an error in data transmission. The data received was inconsistent and appeared to be sent at approximately <b>140000 baud</b>, leading to about <b>20% error in UART communication.</b>

• <b>Root Cause:</b>

After thorough debugging, we realized that the ATmega328P microcontroller was operating at a 20 MHz clock frequency instead of the expected 16 MHz. The incorrect assumption of the clock frequency had resulted in inaccurate prescaler calculations for the UART baud rate, causing the mismatch.

• <b>Resolution</b>:To resolve this issue:

• <b>Prescaler Adjustment:</b> We recalculated the prescaler value for the UART baud rate based on the 20 MHz clock frequency, ensuring accurate baud rate settings.

• Verification with <b>Saleae Logic Analyzer:</b>
    We used a Saleae Logic Analyzer to analyze the transmitted and received UART signals.
    The logic analyzer allowed us to confirm the actual baud rate being transmitted and verify that the adjusted prescaler correctly aligned the transmission rate with the configured baud rate of 115200.


## 8. Power Management

![alt text](Images/4_PowerManagement.png)

<p>• The power management system in the 3pi robot is a sophisticated design that ensures optimal performance for the device, even as battery voltage fluctuates during operation. The system addresses the challenge of inconsistent battery voltage from four AAA cells, which can range between 3.5 V and 5.5 V (or even up to 6 V for alkaline batteries). This variability makes direct voltage regulation to 5 V impractical. To overcome this, the 3pi employs a dual-regulation approach, utilizing both a switching regulator and a linear regulator.</p>

<p>• First, the switching regulator boosts the battery voltage to a stable 9.25 V (Vboost), which is used to power the motors and IR LEDs in the line sensors. Then, a linear regulator reduces Vboost to 5 V (VCC), supplying the microcontroller and digital circuitry. This dual-regulation method provides several advantages. The motors benefit from higher voltage and, consequently, more power without increased current demand, enabling consistent performance regardless of battery depletion. Additionally, the regulated voltage ensures that motor speeds remain constant, simplifying programming tasks such as timed turns. Furthermore, the higher voltage enables the IR LEDs to be powered in series, minimizing power consumption.</p>

<p>• The system also incorporates a voltage monitoring circuit to help track battery status. This is achieved using a voltage divider, which scales the battery voltage to a level safely below the microcontroller's 5 V maximum analog input. This scaled voltage is fed to an ADC input and converted into the actual battery voltage using a simple formula. We monitored the battery voltage by a function, read_battery_millivolts_3pi(), that automates this process by averaging ten ADC samples and returning the battery voltage in millivolts.</p>

• In summary, the 3pi’s power management system ensures maximum performance until the battery is fully drained, offering regulated voltage for reliable operation of all components while monitoring battery health for proactive power management.
